# tado-homeassistant-offset

I'm currently still fiddling with this to find a good working stratergy that unlike the original I've forked from, doesn't change the offset too often, draining the battery and making noise.

As it's my summer (northern hemisphere) at the moment, this project is on pause, as I can't test.

This fork is me tweaking playing -- just a sandbox for now
